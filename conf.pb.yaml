# Plumber Configuration - Trust Policy Manager for GitLab CI/CD
# This file is required for 'plumber analyze' to work.
# Default file name: conf.pb.yaml

version: "1.0"

# Controls configuration
# Each control can be enabled/disabled and customized
controls:

  # ===========================================
  # Mutable Image Tag Control
  # ===========================================
  # Detects CI/CD jobs using Docker images with mutable tags.
  # Mutable tags (like 'latest') can point to different images over time,
  # making builds non-reproducible and potentially introducing security risks.
  #
  # Best practice: Use immutable tags (e.g., specific versions or SHA digests)
  imageMutable:
    # Set to false to disable this control
    enabled: true
    
    # Tags considered "mutable" - images using these will be flagged
    mutableTags:
      - latest
      - dev
      - development
      - staging
      - main
      - master
      # v8.15.0
      # Add your organization's custom mutable tags below:
      # - nightly
      # - edge
      # - canary
      # - unstable

  # ===========================================
  # Untrusted Image Control
  # ===========================================
  # Detects CI/CD jobs using Docker images from untrusted registries.
  # Only images from explicitly trusted sources should be used in pipelines
  # to prevent supply chain attacks.
  #
  # Best practice: Maintain a list of approved registries and image patterns
  imageUntrusted:
    # Set to false to disable this control
    enabled: true
    
    # Trust official Docker Hub images (e.g., nginx, alpine, python)
    # These are images without a username prefix on Docker Hub
    trustDockerHubOfficialImages: true
    
    # Trusted registry URLs and patterns (supports wildcards)
    # Images matching these patterns will be considered trusted
    trustedUrls:
      # Docker Hub official images (if trustDockerHubOfficialImages is false)
      # - docker.io/library/*
      
      # Common CI/CD tool images
      - docker.io/docker:*
      - gcr.io/kaniko-project/*
      
      # GitLab registry patterns
      - registry.gitlab.com/*
      - $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:*
      - $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE/*
      
      # Add your organization's trusted registries below:
      # - your-registry.example.com/*
      # - ghcr.io/your-org/*

  # ===========================================
  # Branch Protection Control
  # ===========================================
  # Checks that repository branches have proper protection settings.
  # Ensures critical branches (like main/master) are protected
  # from force pushes and require code reviews.
  #
  # Best practice: Protect default branch and release branches
  branchProtection:
    # Set to false to disable this control
    enabled: true
    
    # Require the default branch to be protected
    defaultMustBeProtected: true
    
    # Branch name patterns that must be protected (supports wildcards)
    namePatterns:
      - main
      - master
      - release/*
      - production
      - dev
      # Add your organization's protected branch patterns below:
      # - develop
      # - staging
    
    # When false, force push must be disabled on protected branches
    allowForcePush: false
    
    # Require code owner approval for changes
    codeOwnerApprovalRequired: false
    
    # Minimum access level required to merge (0=No one, 30=Developer, 40=Maintainer)
    minMergeAccessLevel: 30
    
    # Minimum access level required to push (0=No one, 30=Developer, 40=Maintainer)
    minPushAccessLevel: 40
